# Why am I blogging?

<ol>
<li><p>To force myself fighting <strong>stagnation and laziness</strong>. Blogging is a tangible proof of a journey. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Because I’m a follower of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck">grow-mindset</a></strong> theory; with this blog, I don’t want to demonstrate that <em>“Hey, I am super cool, I don’t fail!”</em>; instead I want to share that <em>“try, experiments, and failure are the most important ingredients for the next challenge”</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing, communication</strong>: I’d like to found people to share my thoughts or my code and get any useful feedback.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a developer, design and implement simply are not enough: I believe in the power of a <strong>team</strong> and, with a wider perspective, of the whole community; that’s why in my opinion the ability to convey with the right <strong>language</strong> the concepts, the experience and to listen to feedback is simply essentials. Blogging is one way to train this skill.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because a blog is, after all, a (small) <strong>piece of web</strong> and I am a web developer. This way I can use it as a perfect container for my tests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To improve <strong>my English</strong>! I must apologize for my very basic level and for my mistakes, but I don’t want that my first language (Italian) to be a bottleneck for a potential friend, collaborators or simply interesting people.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Why-Now"><a href="#Why-Now" class="headerlink" title="Why Now?"></a>Why Now?</h1><p>Another question that I posed to myself when I started this blog was: <em>why now?</em>.<br>In this case, the answers are also very specific to my own experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because I am in the middle of a <strong>turning point</strong> in my career and my life; I finished an important chapter of my professional path and I am about to start a new exciting adventure, which involves a radical change in terms of working team, environment, technology, logistics and so on. For these reasons the motivation and the timing are perfect, I think, to create something that for many years was spinning in my mind but I always postponed.</li>
<li>Because the web development ecosystem is changing a lot in the last years: the web platform progresses, the open source explosion, the whole community ability to contribute and give immediate feedback… all these aspects make this <em>job</em> very exciting but also the meaning of <strong>seniority</strong> and <strong>skillset</strong> are becoming much more volatiles; blogging in my opinion, together with public coding, is the right way to grow and contribute as an active part of the whole community.</li>
<li>And finally because…<strong>why not</strong>?!</li>
</ol>
